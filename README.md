Basic Information of This Project:

In this project, a community-based web application that focuses on individual users 
was designed and implemented. This web application empowers authenticated users to 
participate in MPC sessions with other users together to carry out electronic voting and 
surveys. The community feature of this web application allows users to post their own 
voting and surveys in a group or under a topic so that users can initiate voting and
surveys that target a particular group of individuals in accordance with their actual 
requirements. In addition, the MPC related functions in this application were 
implemented by employing the JavaScript library JIFF (JavaScript Implementation of 
Federated Functionalities) which has been developed by researchers at Boston 
University.
